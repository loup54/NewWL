# Production Environment Setup Guide

## âœ… Completed Configuration:
1. **Environment Configuration** - Production-ready settings in `src/utils/environment.ts`
2. **Service Worker** - PWA support with offline capabilities in `public/sw.js`
3. **Build Optimization** - Optimized Vite configuration for production builds
4. **Asset Management** - Proper chunking and caching strategies

## ðŸš€ Production Deployment Steps:

### 1. Domain and SSL Setup:
```bash
# In Lovable Project Settings > Domains:
# - Add your custom domain (e.g., wordlens.app)
# - SSL certificates are automatically provisioned
# - Update DNS records as instructed
```

### 2. Supabase Production Configuration:
```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard:
# 1. Go to Settings > API
# 2. Copy production URL and anon key
# 3. Update Site URL to your production domain
# 4. Add redirect URLs for authentication
```

### 3. Environment Variables (if using external hosting):
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://ccmyjrgrdymwraiuauoq.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 4. Build and Deploy:
```bash
# Build optimized production version
npm run build

# Deploy to Lovable (automatic)
# Or deploy to your hosting provider
npm run preview  # Test production build locally
```

### 5. Performance Optimizations:
- âœ… Code splitting by vendor, UI, and feature chunks
- âœ… Asset optimization and compression
- âœ… Service worker for offline functionality
- âœ… Lazy loading of routes and components
- âœ… CSS minification and tree shaking

### 6. Security Configurations:
- âœ… Content Security Policy enabled
- âœ… HTTPS enforcement in production
- âœ… Input sanitization and validation
- âœ… Supabase RLS policies active

### 7. Monitoring and Analytics:
- âœ… Error reporting enabled in production
- âœ… Performance monitoring configured
- âœ… Service worker background sync
- âœ… Proper logging levels

## ðŸ“± Mobile App Configuration:

### Update Capacitor for Production:
```bash
# After production setup, update capacitor.config.ts
# Replace development URLs with production URLs
```

### App Store URLs:
- **Production API**: https://ccmyjrgrdymwraiuauoq.supabase.co
- **Production Web**: https://wordlens.app (or your domain)
- **Authentication**: Configure redirect URLs in Supabase

## ðŸ”’ Security Checklist:
- [ ] Custom domain with SSL configured
- [ ] Supabase authentication URLs updated
- [ ] RLS policies reviewed and tested
- [ ] Content Security Policy active
- [ ] Service worker security headers
- [ ] File upload validation enabled

## ðŸ“Š Performance Targets:
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 1.5s
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: < 2.5s
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: < 0.1
- **First Input Delay**: < 100ms
- **Bundle Size**: < 500KB (gzipped)

## ðŸš¨ Pre-Launch Testing:
1. Test all features in production environment
2. Verify offline functionality works
3. Test file uploads and document processing
4. Validate authentication flows
5. Check mobile responsiveness
6. Performance audit with Lighthouse
7. Security scan completion

Your production environment is now configured with enterprise-grade optimizations!
